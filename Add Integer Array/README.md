This program was written by me in about 15 minutes just after midnight on August 5th, 2019 after I was reading comments on a dev.to article and saw somebody who was interviewing for dev jobs complain that job applicants couldn't even do this simple program.

I wrote this in C++ on my MacBook Pro in gedit without the benefit of an IDE.

The program contains a function that takes 2 arrays of integers, each representing a big integer stored with 100% precision, and returns the sum. Each integer in the arrays is a natural number between 0 and 9, inclusive. Position 0 in the array is the leftmost digit of the big integer, position 1 is the second leftmost digit and so on. If array 1 contains 9 2 5 and array 2 contains 8 6 then the resulting array will contain 1 0 1 1.

The main function is a driver which permits the user to enter integers in order to test the program.
