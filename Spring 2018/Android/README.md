Most of my assignments for this class involved adding features to my Baseball Manager game. The game's source code is proprietary as a future version of the game may be released on Google Play and other Android app stores.

The .apk file for Baseball Manager as of my live demo during the final class meeting on April 26th, 2018 is available here.
