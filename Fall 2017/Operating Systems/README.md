Attribution: Some of this code may have been based on startup code written by the professor (Dr. Linda Null). I don't remember at this point and can't tell just from looking at it.

For this class, we used the Ben-Ari Concurrent Interpreter (BACI) (available @ http://inside.mines.edu/~tcamp/baci/baci_index.html) which uses a limited subset of C++. BACI is a teaching tool that is not, in any way, suitable for real world software development.
