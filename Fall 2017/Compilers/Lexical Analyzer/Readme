To compile my code, load a terminal, cd into the right directory, place ParserVal.java, Program.java and jflex-1.6.1.jar in the same directory and enter the following commands into the terminal:

java -jar jflex-1.6.1.jar Lex.flex
javac *.java

The first command creates a file called Lex.java. The second compiles all of the .java files. To run my compiler, use the following command:

java Program [filename]

Replace [filename] with the name of a .foo file containing foo language code.
