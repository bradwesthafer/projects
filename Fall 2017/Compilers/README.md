Attribution: The code for the Syntax Checker was written entirely by me. The other projects for this class contain startup code written by the instructor (Dr. Hyuntae Na). The Foo language programs were written by Dr. Na and are included in this repository so that the code can be tested.

The various versions of the Foo language used for this course did have context free grammars. I may add them in the future if I find them.

The only bug in this code, to the best of my knowledge, is in the JFlex for floating point numbers in the Lexical Analyzer. I discovered it and fixed it while working on the Syntax Checker as it had not been detected by the grader for the class.

This code is in Java and utilizes JFlex and BYACC/J.
