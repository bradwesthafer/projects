Homework 1

To run search using my version of farmer.ss, type in (load "farmer.ss") and make any of the following function calls:

(farmer-depth-first init)
(farmer-breadth-first init)
(fdf init)
(fbf init)

fdf and fbf are shorthands for farmer-depth-first and farmer-breadth-first just like cdf and cbf are shorthands in coins.ss.
